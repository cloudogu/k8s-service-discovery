# Use of a self-signed SSL certificate


The SSL certificate is generated by k8s-service-discovery and stored in the secret `ecosystem-certificate` as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
 name: ecosystem-certificate
 namespace: ecosystem
type: Opaque
data:
  tls.crt: <public_key>
  tls.key: <private_key>
```

Therefore, the secret with the certificate is leading compared to the global config.

The k8s-service-discovery reconciles the secret and writes the public key to the global config as follows:
- `certificate/server.crt`.

> If the FQDN is changed and a self-signed SSL certificate is used, this is automatically regenerated and applied.
> For FQDN changes, the Dogus must also be restarted so that they receive this change.
